# Aeropulse-Flight-Fare-Prediction-System
Aeropulse leverages historical data, current market trends, and sophisticated algorithms to analyze 
and predict fare movements. Unlike existing platforms that primarily provide current price 
comparisons, Aeropulse delves deeper into the underlying patterns and factors influencing fare 
changes. By offering accurate predictions and actionable insights, Aeropulse aims to transform the 
way travelers approach ticket purchasing. This application not only aids individual travelers but also 
has potential benefits for travel agencies and corporate travel planners who seek to optimize travel 
budgets.
